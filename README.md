# ML Project: Predicting Car Prices  

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict car prices based on features like mileage, year, brand, and fuel type. Using a structured workflow, the dataset was cleaned, explored, and visualized to uncover key trends affecting car prices. Multiple regression models were trained and evaluated, with the best model achieving a reliable RMSE and RÂ² score. The project uses Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. Users can clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the project to predict car prices effectively.
